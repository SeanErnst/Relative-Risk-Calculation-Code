This python code uses SPC tornado report data to calculate a daily climatology of tornadoes in the Lower 48 US, then uses that
climatology to calculate "relative risk" values - either using Practically Perfect Forecasts (PPF) calculated from tornado 
reports, or shapefile polygons of SPC tornado outlooks.  The code also includes a series of plots and spreadsheets developed
as part of an analysis of this dataset.

I have also included the 1950-2021 tornado report dataset used to calculate the climatology performed in this study
here.  The original file (and future versions) are available at https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/1950-2023_actual_tornadoes.csv
