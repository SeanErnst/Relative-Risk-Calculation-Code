This python code uses SPC tornado report data to calculate a daily climatology of tornadoes in the Lower 48 US, then uses that
climatology to calculate "relative risk" values - either using Practically Perfect Forecasts (PPF) calculated from tornado 
reports, or shapefile polygons of SPC tornado outlooks.  The code also includes a series of plots and spreadsheets developed
as part of an analysis of this dataset.
